Vigil is a simple Windows photo viewer which updates when the image file is updated. 

Vigil has a white background so that images with transparency look the way you expect.

Launch vigil by double-clicking `vigil.exe` and drop your image file on to the UI. vigil can also be launched through the command line:

```vigil.exe image.bmp```

No install needed, just unzip the folder containing the executable.
